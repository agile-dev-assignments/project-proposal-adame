## Title: Ultimate Movie Review 
Title and project functions subject to change. 

### What and Why?:
A Google search of a movie usually shows Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, and MetaCritic scores first before other reviews. 
However, Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic can differ greatly from user/audience reviews. In some cases, Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic can be biased or misleading. 
The Ultimate Movie Review is a website that averages user/audience reviews(imdb/google user reviews/amazon prime reviews) into a separate score for a given movie. It would also average individual critic reviews(from websites like the guardian, medium, roger ebert, etc.) into another score. Possibly, there could be a third score that averages both audience and critic scores into one ultimate score. So instead of Rotten Tomatoes, MetaCritic, and IMDb being the deciding factor in movie reviews, you have three other scores that are more represenative and relaiable.  

### For Whom? 
This software would be for the average person/consumer that search up movie reviews. 

### How?
A user will enter the name of the movie and be presented with the three different scores. The program will web scrape the audience reviews from IMDb, Google, etc. and average them into an "audience score". The program will then web scrape and average critic scores into a "critic score". It will finally average both audience and critic scores into an "ultimate score". 

### Scope
The website would need to look polished using appealing graphics in the front-end design. If the calculating of  scores is not enough work for 4-6 people, we could add filters to filter in/out different websites such as Rotten Tomatoes/MetaCritic so users can customize the score calculations.
